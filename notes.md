Eternal because every ending is a new beginning, infinite because everything circles back to where it started, perfect because it moves indivisibly as one. Indescribably vast, it dwindles to nothing at all.

Love gives us courage, saving lets us spend, not bossing people around gets the best results.

```
function longevityAndProsperity(conservation = true, cooperation = true) {
     conservatation = adaptability;
     adaptability = potential;
     opportunity = false;
     risk = false;
     if (potential) {
         opportunity = true;
     }
     if (opportunity) {
        risk = true;
     }
     if (risk && cooperation) {
         return true;
     }
     return false;
}
```

We have a mission but we don't explain it. We're creating something but not to own it. We're doing something but not to save anyone. We're leading them but not to slaughter. We'll get there but it's not the promised land.

Make it plain, keep it simple, be less needy, don't be greedy.

Be like water. Water helps everything and takes people's shit. It's consistent, open, tolerant, kind, fair, useful and adaptable, and above all, it doesn't get angry and hold grudges.
