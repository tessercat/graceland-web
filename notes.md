Eternal because every ending is a new beginning, infinite because everything circles back to where it started, perfect because it moves indivisibly as one. Indescribably vast, it dwindles to nothing at all.

Love gives us courage, saving lets us spend, not bossing people around gets the best results.

```
function liveLongAndProsper(
     conservation = true,
     cooperation = true) {
   adaptability = conservation;
   potential = adaptability;
   opportunity = false;
   risk = false;
   if (potential) {
     opportunity = true;
   }
   if (opportunity) {
     risk = true;
   }
   if (risk && cooperation) {
     return true;
   }
   return false;
}
```

Make it plain, keep it simple, be less needy, don't be greedy.

Be like water. Water helps everything and takes people's shit. It's consistent, open, tolerant, kind, fair, useful and adaptable, and above all, it doesn't get angry and hold grudges.
